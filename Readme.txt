Explanation:
1. 01_data: The results calculated by the method proposed in this article include features and target variables. Due to the actual data being classified, it has been standardized.
2. 02_automl_ASP.py: The core code for training and optimizing models using the Autosklearn 2.0 automatic machine learning system.
3. 03_automl_ASP.pickle: The optimal model optimized by Python based Autosklearn2.0 automatic machine learning system after 24 hours of training.
4. The above three attachments can be used to view and verify automatic machine learning models and calculation results. And the computer needs to be configured with a Python environment and installed with Autosklearn2.0 and other basic support libraries.
